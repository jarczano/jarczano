# Hello, I'm Jaros≈Çaw Turczyn! üëã

I'm a mathematics and environmental engineering graduate from Poznan University of Technology who discovered a passion for programming and artificial intelligence. My journey into the world of technology has been an exciting one, and I'm eager to share some of my work and interests with you.

- üå± I'm constantly learning and exploring new horizons in technology.
- üåç I'm based in Poland.

### My Portfolio

In my portfolio, you'll find a mix of projects that reflect my diverse interests and skills:

#### Sudoku Solver Web App

I created a web app capable of recognizing and solving Sudoku puzzles in real-time using Python, Flask, OpenCV, and TensorFlow. Check it out [here](https://github.com/jarczano/Sudoku-Solver-Web-App).

#### Texas Hold'em Poker Web App

My other project is a web-based Texas Hold'em Poker game with a twist. It features three different bots:

- **Bob**: A bot that relies on probability and statistics.
- **Carol**: An AI bot trained with reinforcement learning (DNN).
- **Dave**: A bot powered by the OpenAI GPT API for decision-making.
